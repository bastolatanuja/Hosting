data types:
Character-''
example 'tanuja'

numeric-as.numeric is way to write.
it include all types of numeric value

Integer- includes only positive value.
example- a=1l (denoted as integer in R)

complex-it includes real ande imaginary value.
example-1+5j

logical- it includes logical value as true false.

data objects:
types;

1)vector(can include only one value)
2)list(all values included as vectors or more)
3)Matirixs
4)index
5)arrays(combination of matrixes)
6)data frame(tabular form data)
7)operators(3 types of operator[arithmetic, logical,relation])


note:
%%= reminder 				%/%=integer division

!=logical not			&=element wise logical and   &&=logical And
|=element wise logical or 		||=logical or

operators & and | perform elemet-wise operation producing reslut having length
of the longer operand.

but && and || examines only thefirst element of the operands resulting into
a single ledngth logical vector.

Zero is considered FALSE and non-zero number are taken as TRUE.
examples:
logic_a=c(TRUE, FALSE, 0, 100)
logic_b=c(FALSE, TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
